            <h3>Hobbies & Interest</h3>
        </article>
            <p>
                My hobbies & interest change like the seasons, but I have a few core hobbies that
                have not faded for years. some of them include:
            <ul>

                    <li>Riding Motorcycles
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>I've always had a interest in motorcycles watching my father as I grew up.
                                    I bought my first bike when I was 21 and been riding every since.</p>

                                <p>I started fishing about 4 months ago and became addicted.
                                    I'm pescatarian so seafood is a big part of my diet.

                                    I am a knowledge sponge. I enjoy reading law, finance, and
                                    strategy books. A book that I feel is interesting is
                                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197">The 48 Laws of Power.</a>

                                <p>I've always had an interest in the RC World. I use to build
                                    the gas and electric rc cars when I was younger. Drones peaked my
                                    interest around 2014 and I found that it was an expensive hobby. I
                                    explored the commercial side of the UAV industry, got licensed and
                                    started doing freelance commercial work that has included coding.

                                <p>I played multiple instruments growing up so music has naturally stuck
                                    to me. I've had some professional experience in radio & broadcasting
                                    as an On-Air Dj. I still actively DJ for private events such as weddings,
                                    graduations, etc. <br>

                                Finance is one of the keys that control quality of life.
                                I'm extremely interested in quality of life and generational wealth.

                <p>I'm a easy going individual overall. I'm laid back and chill and also a homebody.
                    I'm a big family person. Me and my immediate family are very close although we are 
                    spread out location wise. 
                    Something about me that you probably wouldn't guess is that I used to work in a funeral home.</p>

                <h3>Future Goals & Aspirations</h3>
                <p>I would really like to retire by the age of 40 and travel the world with my kids.
                    My plan is to continue to invest and create multiple streams of income with platforms
                    such as <a href="https://turo.com/">Turo</a> & <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">AirBnB</a>. In due time, I feel like the knowledge, skills, and experience
                    gained from Quotum Tech paired with the other streams of income will help me build my
                    real estate portfolio ultimately allowing me to reach my retirement goal. </p>
